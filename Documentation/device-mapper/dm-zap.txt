dm-zap
======

The dm-zap(Zone Append device mapper) device mapper target turns a set of
sequential write required zones into conventional zones, thus allowing random
writes to a disk only exposing sequential write required zones.

This is useful for applications and filesystems requiring a set of conventional
zones for in-place updates of i.e. metadata.

dm-zap target devices are formatted and checked using the dmzap utility
available at: TBD

Design
======

dm-zap is designed to be a low-overhead(disk/host mem usage) adapter to enable
file systems and applications to store a limited amount of data in an area that
allows random writes.

Disk format
===========

Zones 0..1:    Reserved for superblock storage and for
               persisting mapping data for data in open zones

Zones 2..R-1:  Zones used for storing random writes

Zones R..N-1:  Zones used for storing sequential writes
               Writes to this area are just remapped and
               passed through to the backing media.

N = Number on zones reported by backing media

Example:

Zone      Type    Contents                   Comment
                   _______________________
Zone 0    Meta    |HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM|  Full ZAP_META zone
                  |MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM|
                   -----------------------
Zone 1    Meta    |HMMMMMMMM              |  Active ZAP_META zone
                  |                       |
                   -----------------------
Zone 2    Rand    |HDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD|  Full ZAP_RAND zone
                  |DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDMMMMMMF|
                   -----------------------
Zone 3    Rand    |HDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD|  Active ZAP_RAND zone

                   -----------------------
Zone R-1  Rand    |HDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD|  Full ZAP_RAND zone
                  |DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDMMMMF|
                   -----------------------

                  |DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD|

                  |DDDD                   |
                   -----------------------

                  |DDDD                   |

Metadata
========

A zone header is stored at offset 0 of all zones that are managed by dm-zap.
A zone footer is stored for all random zones.

The header and footers are stored as one dm-zap block (4k).

Header format (512 bytes)

Field           Size(bytes)   Offset  Comment

MAGIC           4               0     {'z','a','p','0'}

SEQUENCE_NR     4               8     Increases monotonically for each
                                      written header
TYPE            4              12     Types: ZAP_META = 0 / ZAP_RAND = 1

CRC             4             504     CRC of all above fields

Footer format (512 bytes)

Field           Size(bytes)  Offset   Comment

SEQUENCE_NR     4               0     Copy of SEQUENCE_NR in the zone header
MAPPING_START   4               4     Start of zone mapping data
                                      relative to zone start adress
RESERVED        500             8     Reserved for future use. Padded with 0xFF
CRC             4             508     CRC of zone mapping data + above fields


The logical-to-device mapping for the random zones are stored at the end of each
random zone. To prevent dataloss because of crashes/powerloss, the mapping data
for the active random zone is stored in the metadata blocks until the random
zone is closed to gurantee that data can be read from disk after a
sync / REQ_PREFLUSH request.

Mapping entry format (8 bytes)

Field           Size(bytes)  Offset   Comment

START           4               0     Logical start block
LENGTH          4               4     Length of write, in 4k blocks
ADDRESS         4               8     Backing block adress

User view
=========

A number of zones is exposed to the user by dm-zap, first a number(C) of
conventional zones that are managed by dm-zap, followed by a number of sequential
write required zones that dm-zap only remaps and passes on to the backing media.

Note that the number of backing zones (R) for the conventional zones is bigger than C.
In addition to user data, the backing zones needs to store mapping metadata and reserve
space for doing garbage collection.

The zone size is the typical zone size reported by the backing media.

Zone        Type

Zone 0      BLK_ZONE_TYPE_CONVENTIONAL
Zone 1      BLK_ZONE_TYPE_CONVENTIONAL
Zone ..     BLK_ZONE_TYPE_CONVENTIONAL
Zone C      BLK_ZONE_TYPE_CONVENTIONAL
Zone C+1    BLK_ZONE_TYPE_SEQWRITE_REQ
Zone ..     BLK_ZONE_TYPE_SEQWRITE_REQ
Zone N-1    BLK_ZONE_TYPE_SEQWRITE_REQ

Usage
=====

A zoned block device must first be formatted using the dmzap tool. This will
check the zone configuration of the disk, calculate the number of zones
to reserve for the conventional zones and write the superblock.

The dmz tool also supports repairing the disk after a crash or a powerloss.

Formatting the disk is needed prior to using it for the first time:

[[
##!/bin/sh
# format disk using the dmzap tool
dmzap format --conventional 8 $1
]]

Once the disk is formatted, the device mapper target can be created:

[[
##!/bin/sh
# create dm-zap target
dev=$1
echo "0 `blockdev --getsize ${dev}` zap ${dev}" | dmsetup create dmzap-`basename ${dev}`
]]

This will result in a disk exposing 8 conventional zones with the same size
as the disk's sequential write required zones.
